This is intended as a minimal configuration for Emacs beginners.
The idea is that because it is small, it can easily be built on and
learned from.  Yet it should provide a more pleasing out-of-the-box
experience than starting with no configuration.  Suggestions follow.

This configuration opens this file and any other Emacs Lisp file
with `outline-minor-mode` enabled.  This makes it possible to view
the headings as a list and more easily browse their contents.  To
collapse all headings into a list, enter "C-c @ C-o" To open a
heading and view its contents, click the arrow to the right of the
heading, or place the cursor on the heading and then enter "C-c @
C-s".

A minimal set of third-party packages will be installed on
first-run.  They are:

* dumb-jump - Jump to the definition of the symbol at point by
  pressing "M-.", and return when done by pressing "M-,".

* ef-themes - A set of attractive and well-thought-out themes.  A
  built-in theme is selected on first run, but you can select a
  different one from this package or another by doing "M-x
  customize-themes RET".

* marginalia - Adds useful annotations added to \*Completions\* lists.
  It's also used by Vertico if that's installed.

* minimap - A miniature sidebar map (open with "f9").

* rainbow-delimiters - Matching parentheses and brackets are easily
  identified by their matching colors.  If you find this distracting,
  do "M-x package-delete RET rainbow-delimiters" to remove the
  package.  An alternative and less distracting way to match pairs is
  to use the built-in `show-paren-mode`, which you can enable from the
  Options menu by checking the box next to "Highlight Matching
  Parentheses".

* sr-speedbar - A file/buffer/info browsing sidebar (open with "f8").
  This package allows the built-in Speedbar to act as a sidebar
  window, rather than a separate frame.

* which-key - Emacs has a lot of keybindings.  And a lot of commands
  require a sequence of keys, not just one.  This package
  automatically shows you the available keybindings in a pop-up
  whenever you press a prefix key like "C-x", "C-c", "C-h", "M-s", or
  "M-g".  To see top-level bindings that are available without using a
  prefix key, press "C-h t".
  
* yasnippet + yasnippet-snippets - Snippets, and lots of them, to ease
  entry of common text structures.  These are accessible from the
  menu-bar or by entering a trigger-abbreviation and pressing "TAB".

There are other intended-to-be-helpful preconfigured settings, such
as:

* Indentation highlighting in Python files using the built-in
`whitespace-mode`

* Linefeeds (aka pagebreaks) displayed as horizontal lines, rather
  than the unslightly "^L" character

* Enhanced built-in commands which don't come enabled by default
  are enabled here, such as `cycle-spacing` instead of
  `just-one-space` ("M-SPC"), and `ibuffer` instead of
  `list-buffers` ("C-x C-b")

* The built-in completions system has been configured with sensibleâ„¢
  defaults.
  
You can access the \*Completions\* buffer by pressing "TAB" or
"C-n" in the minibuffer.  This may be slow if you do it without
narrowing the number of potential completions first.  For example
when you use "C-h v" to get the description of a variable, if you
press "TAB" without entering any text, Emacs will have to compile
a list of all variables it knows, which could take a few seconds.

But if that proves to be an annoyance, feel free to "package-install
RET vertico RET".

The Vertico, Consult, Embark, Marginalia, Lin, and Corfu packages are
recommended for installation, and all have been pre-configured.

Diff-hl is also recommended for use with version-control, whether
the built-in `vc-mode` or the external Magit package.

The Eglot package is also recommended, but it must be used with
any of several "language server" programs that correspond to the
programming language you are writing in.  The language server
runs on your computer, but you must install it separately, using
your operating system's package manager.

The author prefers to disable certain user-interface features such as
`scroll-bar-mode` and `tool-bar-mode` but will not assume that others
share the same preference.  However, you can toggle those features
(and many others) from the Options menu in the "Show/Hide" submenu.

The idea is to provide an attractive starting point for your Emacs
configuration in a single init file that stays relatively close to
"vanilla" Emacs, while also including some bells and whistles to keep
it interesting.

Of course, you can (and should) change the configuration as you see
fit.  And you can (and should) experiment with different settings.

The configuration sections of packages that have been deleted
are skipped.  Settings that have been customized will override
settings found in the main init file.
